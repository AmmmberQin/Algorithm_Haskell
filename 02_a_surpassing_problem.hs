-- a surpasser of an element of an arry is a greater element to the right, so x[j] is a surpasser of x[i] if i < j and x[i] < x[j]
-- the surpasser count of an element is the number of its surpassers
-- Compute the maximum surpasser count of an array of length n > 1 and to do so with an O(nlgn) algorithm
